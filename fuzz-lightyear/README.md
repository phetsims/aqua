# To run:

Open `aqua/fuzz-lightyear/` with the relevant query parameters in a browser.

# Query parameters:

- All query parameters (except ?wrapperName) will be passed to the simulation. To detect errors, it is recommended to
  pass at least `?ea`, and for fuzzing, other query parameters (like ?fuzz) are recommended.
- testTask {boolean} Whether a tested sim should be left open after loading. If false, it will move to the next
  simulation immediately upon the previous simulation loading. Defaults to true.
- testSims {Array.<string>} Comma-separated list of sims to be tested. Defaults to sims in active-runnables
- loadTimeout {number} - The time the sim has to load before moving to the next test, in ms. Defaults to 30000 (30
  seconds).
- testDuration {number} Milliseconds to keep simulations open when testTask:true. Starts counting from when the sim
  loads. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds).
- wrapperName {string} - specify the PhET-iO wrapper to load each sim into. For reporting, this should be accompanied
  by `&wrapperContinuousTest=%7B%7D`.

#### Status Box:

- Gray: not yet reached
- Blue: loading
- Orange: failure loading (before running sim)
